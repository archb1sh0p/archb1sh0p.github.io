See here for the details, I shan&amp;rsquo;t bore you again.
Setting the scene&amp;hellip; I recently found myself in a position with a client where they passed on a request that was: “Our CISO has requested that we go out and find all privileged service accounts”
For this particular client service accounts are identified with “SRV_ACC” at the start of the username.</description>

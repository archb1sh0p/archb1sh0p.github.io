      <description>This is going to be the first in a series of posts chronicling my journey with PowerShell:
See here for the details, I shan&amp;rsquo;t bore you again.
Setting the scene&amp;hellip; I recently found myself in a position with a client where they passed on a request that was: “Our CISO has requested that we go out and find all privileged service accounts”
For this particular client service accounts are identified with “SRV_ACC” at the start of the username.</description>

      <description>whois archbishop... I like solving problems, and learning new things, I suppose this is where you put that you&amp;rsquo;re a perpetual student and all that jazz.
Just another dude who likes breaking stuff, just really slowly because I&amp;rsquo;m a bit dumb.
During the day I work in a Security Operations Center as an Lead Analyst
What I also like is people, so feel free to reach out, I&amp;rsquo;m also on OJ&amp;rsquo;s discord as &amp;ldquo;TheArchbishop&amp;rdquo; I can be reached at archb1sh0p[at]protonmail[dot]com and if you feel so inclined you can use the below PGP key.</description>

      <title>How to PowerShell More Betterer</title>
      <link>https://archbishop.io/posts/how-to-powershell-more-betterer/</link>

      <description>Why? There are thousands of blogs, posts and resources out there already about PowerShell, did we really some other numpty sharing their thoughts? This is the question I asked myself when the thought first flashed across my mind, &amp;ldquo;I could make a blog&amp;rdquo;. Making a blog is pretty easy these days, but apparently an important part of having a blog is actually having content on it, and given that I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything new to share or any cool tools to release.</description>

<p>This is the question I asked myself when the thought first flashed across my mind, &ldquo;I could make a blog&rdquo;. Making a blog is pretty easy these days, but apparently an important part of having a blog is actually having content on it, and given that I don&rsquo;t have anything new to share or any cool tools to release. I kind of drew a blank about what to write about.</p>
<p>So why did I pick PowerShell&hellip;</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I&rsquo;m going to debut with the topic of PowerShell.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I&rsquo;m not very good at PowerShell. I find for me that writing something down and attempting to explain it to others is a pretty good guarantee that I understand something. This will also have the benefit of tracking my progress over time.</li>
<li>Secondly, I want to share knowledge. I don&rsquo;t know a lot, but I hope that I might be able to explain something in a way that perhaps helps someone understand something better. Even if just one person benefits then I consider it a win. Maybe I might even teach someone something new, who knows.</li>
<li>Thirdly, I really like PowerShell as a tool, and have found it to be very useful to me in my job. So much tooling is built with PowerShell, from <a href="https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire">C2 frameworks</a> to working with any Microsoft Product (including <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-3.8.0">Azure</a> and O365). It is not the be all and end all, but I have found it to have excellent documentation with a large community.</li>
<li>Bonus reason. Also, given how a lot of PowerShell is built and well integrated around C# and .Net I have found it a bit of gateway drug to C# (also  <a href="https://twitter.com/TheColonial">OJ&rsquo;s</a> influence <a href="https://twitter.com/TheColonial"></a>and his streams of building a <a href="https://github.com/OJ/clr-meterpreter">CLR Meterpreter</a>), I have a goal of further down the road teaching myself more and more C#</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this will be a productive venture. For you, the reader, and also for me.</p>
<p>Only time will tell&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
